            How much would you like to raise; What skills/expertise do you require; What assets
            would you like to get access to; Title of campaign; [Create My Campaign] (campaign can be edited or
            deleted). (Please refer to FundIt for options to Preview, Save campaign and Review &amp; Launch). Also
            for contents to complete the steps before campaign can be launched e.g. Campaign Tag Line,
            Campaign Image, Location, Category etc. Users have 6 months from starting a campaign to launching it
            (Can be reviewed later). The option for Pre-launch is also good- having a landing page to get e-mails
            and potential client information (Please refer to FundIt).
